# E-Student-Point
Time and good health are the two major factors at any point in life. Time is very precious for all,
mainly for the young talents of India. Waiting for the printouts in the photocopy stores where
there are huge crowds and long queues, is like just risking our lives in this pandemic and also
wasting a lot of unnecessary time in the queue. Hence to solve this problem and digitalize
everything I have come up with a website named “E-Student Point” .This helps the students in
saving their time wasted in the queue and also avoid crowding near the store.
1. In the proposed system first time, there will be a signup page where all students of NHCE
will enter their name, USN, email-id, phone number, and a unique password and register
themselves. For the rest of times login page will be selected where they have to enter
their email id and password where these data will be compared with the database if it
matches login permission is provided else error message and restriction to login is
created.
2. After the successful login process students will be redirected to the home page of the
website "E-Student Point".
3. Where students can submit their document in any format .png, .pdf, .doc, etc. After
submitting the document students can select the number of copies, colour or black and
other print credentials
4. After submitting all details needed for printing payment is done and transaction receipt is
added along with it.
5. In the end, once the student receive a message via mail from the photocopy shop workers
to come and collect their copies students can go take their copies at photocopy shop by
just saying their unique code received in the mail without waiting in a long queue or
participating in crowds.

How to run the code :
1.Download the zip file ,extract te zip file and save the files by creataing a folder myproject in htdocs.
2.Now you can run the code from localhost using http://localhost/myproject/Imperial/ command.
